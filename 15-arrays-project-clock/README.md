## GOALS:

### ðŸ‘‰ [STEP #1 â€” Print the Digits](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/15-arrays-project-clock/01-printing-the-digits/)
- [x] Define a new placeholder type
- [x] Create the digit arrays from 0 to 9
- [x] Put them into the "digits" array
- [x] Print them side-by-side

### ðŸ‘‰ [STEP #2 â€” Print the Clock](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/15-arrays-project-clock/02-printing-the-clock/)
- [x] Get the current time
- [x] Create the clock array
- [x] Print the clock
- [x] Add the separators

### ðŸ‘‰ [STEP #3 â€” Animate the Clock](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/15-arrays-project-clock/03-animating-the-clock/)
- [x] Create an infinite loop to update the clock
- [x] Update the clock every second
- [x] Clear the screen before the infinite loop
- [x] Move the cursor to the top-left corner of the screen before each
      step of the infinite loop

### ðŸ‘‰ [BONUS: STEP #4 â€” Blink the Clock](https://github.com/inancgumus/learngo/tree/master/15-arrays-project-clock/04-blinking-the-separators/)
- [x] Blink the separators
